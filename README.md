## Overview
This project is a web-based clinical decision support application designed to support protocol-based calculation of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion rates.

The tool translates clinical infusion protocols into a structured and accessible digital format to support safe and standardized decision-making.

## Key Features
- GIK infusion rate calculation
- Protocol-oriented clinical workflow
- Lightweight HTML-based implementation
- Designed for scalability and future integration

## Scope
This project serves as a foundational digital health prototype for clinical decision support and protocol digitization initiatives.

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and demonstrational purposes only and does not replace clinical judgment or institutional protocols.
